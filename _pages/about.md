Hello, My name is Filip Kubaszak, my friends call me Pip. I'm an aspiring CAD Technician with experience in Autocad, Solidworks and Fusion 360. I've been working with Solidworks for the past year creating assemblies and technical drawings, I've also been using KiCad to create PCBs for manufacturing. My experience is mostly in electrical assembly but I won't let this limit me, I'm always looking to grow and imrpove my skills, I hope to get involved in projects to learn python, lua or javascript, feel free to reach out to me if you think there is a project that I might be able to help with.
