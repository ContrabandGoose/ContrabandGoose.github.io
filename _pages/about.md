Hello, My name is Filip Kubaszak, my friends call me Pip. I'm an aspiring CAD Technician with experience in Autocad, Solidworks and Fusion 360. I've been working with Solidworks for the past year creating assemblies and technical drawings, I've also been using KiCad to create PCBs for manufacturing. 

My experience is hardware related but I'm very interested in learning to program especially in Python or lua, the languages seem simple yet very versitle. Python has native support within KiCad and can be used to script in features which would be otherwise diffcult to do manually. I would like to collobarte on some open source projects to develop my skills so if you think your project might interest me feel free to contact me.

This site runs best in Chrome, it's easier to have the files embbed and show correctly. If you have any issues drop me an email and I'll see if I can help out.
