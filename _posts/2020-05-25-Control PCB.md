This was the first PCB i worked on. I started out with just a circuit diagram and a recomendation to try using KiCad, I'm glad I tried it out! I've layed out some PCB's manually using Autocad LT and it really doesn't compare to a program like KiCad. The whole process is streamlined and easy to use out of the box, lots of footprints and its easy to change or amend footprints to suit the need. This PCB and the other two PCB's I desgined for the bench top amplifier have gone through a few revisions after the first development PCB's where made.
